[![Preço Campeão](https://github.com/PedroheFagundes/preco-campeao/blob/master/client/public/images/preco-campeao.jpg "Preço Campeão")](https://some-url.dev/)  

I've created this web app using:
- ReactJS and TypeScript for the Client Side;
- NodeJS for the Server Side
- PostgreSQL for Database.

In this CRUD application you can create, update and delete markets, items and associates items in sale to a market.  
The user can see all the sales and browse through it sorted by the lowest price.

You can access the application here:
